 This application contains examples on calling Web APIs via RESTClient. Therefore, for the application to run successfully, it is necessary to enable the Web APIs by the following steps:

a.	Open SnapDevelop IDE, and then open the .NET-DataStore-Example solution. 

If your demo database is SQL Anywhere, the solution is available in %Example Sales App%\Restful_PB\dotnet-datastore_asa\.NET-DataStore-Example.
If your demo database is PostgreSQL, the solution is available in %Example Sales App%\Restful_PB\dotnet-datastore_postgresql\.NET-DataStore-Example.

b.	Test and run the Web APIs in the solution by following the instructions in the README.md.

If your demo database is SQL Anywhere, the README.md is available in %Example Sales App%\Restful_PB\dotnet-datastore_asa.
If your demo database is PostgreSQL, the README.md is available in %Example Sales App%\Restful_PB\dotnet-datastore_postgresql.
